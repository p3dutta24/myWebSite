<p>Marie Curie was born in Warsaw in 1867. Over the course of her lifetime, she accomplished many incredible feats, which includes making groundbreaking discoveries in radiology and being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1921. In her early life, she pursued many scientific studies while later she worked in the scientific field with her husband until his death. She occupied many important roles and was often the first woman to to do. Without her, science would not be in the place it is today.

<p>I chose Marie Curie for several reasons. One of the things I found fascinating about her was that she was respected by both men and woman at a time when woman were still not treated as equal members of society. In fact, she was not only respected but revered even in her lifetime. She was presented with numerous awards, and not one, but two Nobel Peace Prizes. Her intelligence, drive, and dedication far outshone the devastating gender inequality during her life.
